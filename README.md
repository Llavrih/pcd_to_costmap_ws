# Dual-Camera Costmap with Pointcloud2
Costmap Setup for Two RealSense Cameras

Welcome to the dual-camera costmap workspace. Familiarize yourself with `params.yaml` and `pointcloud2_to_costmap.launch`. 

Both cameras' transformations must be set in these files for accurate costmap generation from their combined point cloud data. Adjust the parameters in `params.yaml` for both cameras and ensure the `pointcloud2_to_costmap.launch` matches your robot and camera setup for precise navigation.
